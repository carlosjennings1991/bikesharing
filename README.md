# Bike Sharing in NYC

For this project, we reviewed bike sharing data from the Citi Bikes program in New York City. This was studied with the intent applying this program to Des Moines Iowa, so any key trends from the New York data would greatly inform efforts for subsequent expansions.

### Results 1: Starting Location

In the map above, we can see that most bike starts occur in the dense, tourist & commercial centers of Manhattan, so Central Park-South all the way down to Wall Street.

### Results 2: Ending Locations

Similar to the previous map, but showing ending locations. These closely mirror start locations albeit with minute differences, however the overall pattern is clearly the same.

### Results 3: Checkout Times for Each Bike

Based on the above, we can see that the overwhelming majority of bike trips were short in duration i.e less than 20 minutes.

### Results 4: Checkout Times for Each Bike, by Gender

<img src="https://github.com/carlosjennings1991/bikesharing/blob/main/Rides_by_Bike_by_Gender.png">

Each of the three tracked genders (Male, Female, Unknown) broadly show similar patterns. Most trips are still short in duration, however, Female and Unknown bikers ride durations slow more slowly relative to Male bike rides.

### Results 5: Bike Trips per day, per hour.

The amount of bike rides per day show two general trends. First and foremost, bike rides during weekdays closely parallel rush hour commute times i.e morning and mid-afternoon. Conversely, the weekend there are no morning and afternoon spikes, but rather slowly increase towards noon-2pm. 

There is one curious outlier - Wednesday afternoon. For some reason afternoon rides on Wednesday are much fewer relative to other weekday afternoons.

### Results 6: Bike Trips per day, per hour, per Gender.

This chart shows the above chart, but broken down by gender. A few patterns emerge. Female and Male ride patterns resemble each other, with the male pattern being starker simply as a result of there being more men bike riders. However, those of unknown gender present a different pattern, with slightly more rides ocurring during the weekend vs. weekdays.
